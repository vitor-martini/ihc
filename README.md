# Easy Markdown to Github Pages

## Introduction

This little guide demonstrates how to turn any [Github](http://github.com) repository with a bunch of [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) files into a simple website using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

* You don't need to use the command line or anything other than your browser.
* It doesn't require any knowledge in Jekyll.
* It's completely compatible with any bunch of markdown files you already have in any existing repository without any modification to those files. That includes the basic `README.md` almost all repositories contain.
* The markdown files will remain just as readable and usable in Github than in your website.

* [Here is the link to the Github Pages version](research.md)
